#### Semantic Highlighter

Highlights similar variables on focus

It underlines variables with the same string (for now).
Sublime does this by double-clicking a word but why do two if you can do one!

> *oooh but that is not "semantic"..* - a wise man

Sure. Here are suggestions for you though.

- Use a different [package](https://github.com/vprimachenko/Sublime-Colorcoder)
- Modify your color scheme file using Sublime's "[Hashed Syntax Highlighting](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/color_schemes.html#hashed_syntax_highlighting)"
- use VS Code

##### Installation

1. Install from `packagecontrol.io` or unpack the [zip](https://github.com/kapitanluffy/sublime-semantic-highlighter/archive/master.zip) in your packages directory
2. Create a copy of `Template.sublime-color-scheme.json` and name it to  `YourColorScheme.sublime-color-scheme`

##### Usage

1. Move your cursor to a variable using the following:

    - Mouse ðŸ–±
    - Arrow keys âŒ¨

2. See colored underlines.

##### Features

- See beautiful colors ðŸŒˆ
- Lessens stress (especially when accompanied with â˜•)
- Improve understanding of your co-worker's gibberish code ðŸ˜’
- Easily see where that variable has been hiding ðŸ‘€

#### Commands

- `semantic_highlighter_jump` (`ctrl+shift+l`)
Jump to the next variable in scope

- `semantic_highlighter_edit` (`ctrl+shift+e`)
Edit all the similar variables in scope

##### The color-scheme file

The package comes with a customizable template color scheme that has 144 varying HSL representations. For now, I simply fetch a random number and match it.

##### Improving the highlighting feature

Edit the `scopes` in the settings file.

The plugin will highlight scopes that are considered "variables" (using the `base` scope by default). Editing the `base` scope will probably break things but it's up to you.

Since I cannot do every programming language, you can further improve *variable detection* by creating your own custom scope of your desired syntax.
And if you do, do a PR for it. The world needs you.

To understand how "scopes" work, check out the following links:
